List of things to research and implement




-Should look at ways to get quality estimates of genomes. DASTool does this but not all of them. Believe checkM also does this but is there more to it or better methods?

X-Implement checkm on bins from metabat2 and concoct perhaps. Implement checkm on all contigs data maybe. Might need to see if that needs to be run on DASTool bin results or can be on the raw contigs. - This was done on bins from DASTool for each run

-Other ways to get quality estimates could also be run...

-look into calculating relative abundance with short or long read alignments. Notes mentioned that Derek could share ideas to do this but see what you can find.

--look back at gtdb-tk findings. run again on results from modified DASTool runs but try to determine if this gives any quality estimates or relative abundance estimates. Why was this actually done other than simple annotation for later work? Is it necessary for sheep HiFi work??

--Look at metaflye. This all must be relevant to metaflye so this might give insights into desired data output and graphs

--Determine how to graph and visualize results.
