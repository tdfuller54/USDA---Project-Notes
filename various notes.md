#Notes and things

-sheep venn-kmer diagram pdf for themis appears to be massive cant zoom in to even see? Downloaded this and summary output of themis and will put in documents in folder "themis".

really cant even appreciate the venn-kmer diagram. Truncated maybe??

themis summary zip was extracted and extracted a lot of files. Go back to this


Goals for current to-do.

-Add GTDB-TK into sheep-sample-2 pipeline. This will classify called bins. For now just have it call bins from DASTool output.

---Did he want MAGpy? Read paper, maybe MAGpy does a lot of this???

-Add Eukdetect for classification of eukaryotic genomes. See if this does classify uncalled bins/genomes.

-Quality assessment methods? This might be added incorporated by DASTool and Eukdetect but if more bins are called then may need more quality assessment methods
