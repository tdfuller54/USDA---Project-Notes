K-mer merqury plot seems redundant after talking about using genomescope and discussing heterozygosity earlier... Leave it in or take it out?

Need to add context still and fill in the heterozygosity part of the intro.

Maybe discuss the potential impact of the heterozygosity on genome alignment using minimap2 and circos. This seems to be something mentioned earlier in Derek's additions.
